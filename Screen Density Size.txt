To create alternative bitmap drawables for different densities, you should follow the 3:4:6:8:12:16 scaling ratio between the six primary densities. For example, if you have a bitmap drawable that's 48x48 pixels for medium-density screens, all the different sizes should be:

36x36 (0.75x) for low-density (ldpi)
48x48 (1.0x baseline) for medium-density (mdpi)
72x72 (1.5x) for high-density (hdpi)
96x96 (2.0x) for extra-high-density (xhdpi)
144x144 (3.0x) for extra-extra-high-density (xxhdpi)
192x192 (4.0x) for extra-extra-extra-high-density (xxxhdpi)
